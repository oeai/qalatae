i was thinking of violence reduction in US and i'm not familiar of all those laws that already exist and can be applied in newest proposals and so i guess my opinion can be helpful.
The simple idea is in creating special gun cases for weapon storage with built in radio transmitter, that will send a signal into nearest police car or police station, so if someone will open it or try to move signal will be recieved and secondary is the license for bearing arms and transporting or only safe custody for hunting or self-defense.
so to take the wearing arms license those people will have to get the special acknowledgement and person investigation, as well as paying more taxes and registering their state residence, so police officers will know about their storage can be opened at any time, while for self-defense people will need to pay only service bills for registering their arms.
i don't really like the idea but this can save some lifes and people with weapon can not be as free as others and must comply their obligations to society, so this should be discussed with hunting societies as well so they would have to give their licenses not to anybody knowing that if something will happens then all members of that club will lose their license and will only pay for securing the weapon or they can give it for safe custody into state or military police, or back into hunting club that will have to provide such ability for them.
Here in Russia we got special cases, but without monitoring, but there are special rules of getting and storing weapon, so only mentally-healthy people can buy arms and each year there are few licenses for hunters, so the time of transporting weaponry is pretty much regulated and for many people it will be enough to buy at least strongbox to secure weapon out of kids or thefts - that is a necessary i guess you have proposed that already.
